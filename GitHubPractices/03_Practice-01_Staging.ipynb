    "\n",
    "Following the lectures in w3schools.com, I followed the codes used to create, add and remove files to/from the staging environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **git -- version**\n",
    "    - showed version of git bash\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **mkdir PythonProject**\n",
    "    - created a repository (folder)\n",
    "    - I named it PythonProject because I'm going to create a repository locally for my Python Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **cd PythonProject**\n",
    "    - moved to PythonProject directory (folder)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **git init**\n",
    "    - made the folder a git repository\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **ls**\n",
    "    - listed all the items stored\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **git status**\n",
    "    - said the repository had no commits yet\n",
    "    - it listed the untracked files: only one in this case\n",
    "      - index.html is an html file w3schools provided to be saved in the directory created.\n",
    "    - it said that there's nothing to commit but untracked fiels are present\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **git add --all**\n",
    "    - puts all the file (just index.html in this case) in the staging environment\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **git status**\n",
    "    - said the repository had no commits yet\n",
    "    - has a list of all changes to be commited, indicating that a new file is found: index.html\n",
    "      - index.html is successfully put into the staged environment\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **git restore --staged index.html**\n",
    "    - is supposed to remove index.html but didn't work\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **git reset HEAD index.html**\n",
    "    - another solution in w3schools but didn't work\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **git rm --cached index.html**\n",
    "    - a solution I realized that was written everytime I entered git status"

    "### Other Notes\n",

    "- **git add -A** : another way to add all files to staging area\n",
    "- **git commit -m** : commit staged changes with message\n",
    "- **git commit -a -m**: commit all tracked changes with message, skipping staging (-a)\n",
    "  - DOES NOT WORK FOR NEW/UNTRACKED FILES\n",
    "  - new/untracked files need to go to staging area (use **git add filename**)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **git commit** (without -m): commit staged changes with multiline message - a text editor will open\n",
    "- **git commit --allow-empty -m \"Start project\"**: create empty commit\n",
    "- **git commit --no-edit** : use previous commit message\n",
    "- **git commit --amend --no-edit** : quickly add staged message to previous commit, same message\n",
    "- **git log**: lists all commits\n",
    "  - **git log --oneline**: shorter view\n",
    "  - **git log --stat**: see which files changed in each commit"
